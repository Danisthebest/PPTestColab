#h1 Goblins
#h2 Ancestry Feats

At 1st level, you gain one ancestry feat, and you gain an additional ancestry feat every 4 levels thereafter (at 5th, 9th, 13, and 17th level). As a goblin, you choose from among the following ancestry feats.

1. Burn It
  * Fire fascinates you.  Your **spells** and **alchemical items** that deal **fire** damage gain a conditional bonus to damage equal to half the spell's level or the item's level (minimum 1). You also gain a +1 conditional bonus to any persistent fire damage you deal, whether it's from a spell or not.
2.  City Scavenger
  *  You know that the greatest treasures often look like refuse, and you scoff at those who throw away perfectly good scraps.  You can attempt a **Survival** check to search for food and supplies and to subsist in a city as well as in the wild.  When you do, you gain a +1 circumstance bonus to your **Survival** check.
